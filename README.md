# Machine Learning Distillation for Risk Management

## Mission Overview
This project focused on implementing and benchmarking Machine Learning distillation techniques in the context of bank risk management. Key objectives included evaluating the potential of distillation for enhancing model explainability (XAI) and assessing its applications in credit risk scenarios. The primary techniques used include neural networks, XGBoost, LightGBM, and TensorFlow.

## Project Scope
1. **Literature Review**: Conducted a comprehensive state-of-the-art review on ML distillation techniques and their relevance in risk management, particularly in model explainability.
2. **Data Preparation**: Collected, cleaned, and processed both internal and open-source datasets using Python and SQL.
3. **Credit Risk Tests**: Implemented models on Basel credit risk data, evaluating neural networks, XGBoost, and LightGBM.
4. **Advanced Distillation Techniques**: Explored advanced methods like GANs and Transfer Learning for potential benefits in risk model efficiency.
5. **Performance Evaluation**: Analyzed the strengths and limitations of distillation approaches in a model risk management framework.

## Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
- Documented all processes, methodologies, and results.
- Conducted interactive workshops to share findings and progress with the team.
  
This repository includes reports, data documentation, and related benchmarks.
